## 🎨 Gemine AI Image Generator
Welcome to the Gemine AI Image Generator, a fun and interactive web app that allows users to turn their imaginative prompts into AI-generated images. Whether you're experimenting with prompt engineering or just playing around with visual creativity, this tool makes it simple, fast, and exciting!

📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple HTML5 based user interface for generating AI-powered images using predefined models like Stable Diffusion and Flux. The interface lets users write a creative prompt, select a model, choose how many images to generate, and pick an aspect ratio; all in a sleek and modern design.

🌐 No backend or AI integration is included in this version, it focuses purely on the front-end UI structure.

🚀 Features
Clean and semantic HTML5 structure
Stylish and responsive CSS3 design (external stylesheet)
Prompt form with multiple image generation options
Theme toggle (dark/light mode ready)
“Random Prompt” button for creative inspiration
Image grid section to display generated results
Mobile-friendly layout

📁 Project Structure
📂 Image-Generator-AI/
├── index.html         # Main HTML structure 
├── style.css          # CSS file for styling
├── script.js          # JavaScript for interactivity

🛠️ How It Works
Enter a prompt in the text box (e.g., "A futuristic city in the clouds")
Choose a model like Stable Diffusion or FLUX
Pick how many images you want: 1–4
Select the aspect ratio (e.g., square, landscape, or portrait)
Click "Generate" to produce your AI artwork
Currently, this is just a UI. To make it functional, you’ll need to integrate it with an AI image generation API (like Stability AI or Hugging Face).
